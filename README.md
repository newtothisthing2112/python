These are the python3 codes for a reverse backdoor (note :- do remember to CHANGE the IP and PORT in the code)
Features (for now):
1. move through directories
2. run cmd commands
3. download files
4. upload files
5. take webcam shots
6. take screenshots
7. record microphone

Note :- this backdoor is tested on the lastest updated version of Windows 11 (22 march 2025) and when converted into an exe file using pyinstaller (commands to include while converting --onefile --noconsole) it bypasses the defender.
        Also the commented out part in the backdoor code is for persistence. You can enable it by removing the hashtags.
